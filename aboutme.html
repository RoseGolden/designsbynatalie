   <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
 </div>
 <div class="aboutmeParagragh">
   <p>My love for design began with a passion for Sociology. I loved learning about the way humans evolve, grow within societies, classify themselves and was fascinated to see how these decisions helped determine who people would become. Tiny changes within religions, classes, organizations, and personal moral values taught through familial ties create an identity, and with it comes specific needs. I’ve worked with a number of people in government offices, schools, communities, and conferences where it was imperative for me to understand the true breadth of others’ needs and consider what I can do to enhance their experiences. There were times I’d have to plan social events, gatherings, conferences, and posters advertising resources for the public and it was important that everything I worked on was easily understood. <br>

    <br>I became interested in design as a means of utilizing my creativity to have a greater social impact. What I love most about UX/UI design is that it is creating with a sensible purpose. Design has a huge impact in our world. Design can save lives: the design of a protective suit has helped save the lives of health professionals battling Ebola. There are also designs made to simply help the user do menial tasks, like the popular Netflix “Skip Intro” button. I can design ways for people to gain access to technology or other resources, or even just design an easier way for one person to find what they're looking for on the internet. Regardless of the task, my main goal in design is to makes lives better. I would love to design a way that makes it easier for people to gain access to public resources or design branding for public services so that their work can reach a wider audience. Knowing that my designs are helping people inspires me and keeps me motivated and I am excited to learn from many other brilliant designers who are working to make the world a better place.
