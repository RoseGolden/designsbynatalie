                        <tspan x="0" y="103.5">To begin my approach at solving the issue of trend obsession,  I researched what it was about the most </tspan>
                        <tspan x="0" y="132.5">popular ecommerce websites for clothes like Asos, Topshop, Amazon that made them so popular. I </tspan>
                        <tspan x="0" y="161.5">discovered that not only did they always have the latest trends on hand, but their UI for shopping was quick </tspan>
                        <tspan x="0" y="190.5">and acsessable. All three of these websites valued the user being able to easily find what trend they wanted, </tspan>
                        <tspan x="0" y="219.5">as well as offered other items to purchase that matched well with them. However, I also realized how little </tspan>
                        <tspan x="0" y="248.5">interaction the user would have with the clothing before actually purchasing; leaving it all up to guessing </tspan>
                        <tspan x="0" y="277.5">weather or not the item would fit and leaving possibility for return.      </tspan>
