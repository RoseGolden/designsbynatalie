<h1>Natalie Valcourt</h1>
<h3>UX/UI Designer</h3>
<p>I'm a UX/UI Designer based in New York City. My passion is the connection that people make with one another and how thoughtful design can strengthen that connection as well as provide an easier access to technology. A few things I love are traveling, challenging myself with new experiences, and fine art.</p>
